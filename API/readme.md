We have chosen to work with Aviation API provided online by [AirLabs](https://airlabs.co/). The AirLabs Data API is designed to provide an easy way to obtain flight positioning data
real-time global flight schedules and an impressive array of airlines, routes,airports and other relevant aviation related information.

Requests to the REST API are made using HTTP requests and responses are provided in a format Lightweight JSON, XML or CSV.

Once you have created an AirLabs account, you can obtain a unique API key from your account dashboard.
